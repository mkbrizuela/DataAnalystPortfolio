# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I am Kristine! Welcome to the public repository that I created to showcase my data analysis projects. I am currently training under the ExcelHelpline Data Analytics Bootcamp to equip me with advanced skills in data processing and visualizationâ€”particularly using Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python. Presently, I am also taking up the Google Data Analytics course to further improve my understanding and technical knowledge of formulating data-driven decisions. 

As a chemical engineer, I am no stranger to the significance of data. I have previously dealt with data in the manufacturing of water-based resins and in the design of water treatment plants in the Philippines. I recognize the necessity of analytical and critical thinking in data analysis, in optimization, production efficiency, and design. 

As I transition into the data industry, I genuinely seek avenues and connections for learning and growth. I am eager to contribute and enhance my skills in entry-level data positions as I integrate myself into the field. 

My CV is in this [file](https://github.com/mkbrizuela/DataAnalystPortfolio/blob/main/MK%20Brizuela%20CV.pdf).
